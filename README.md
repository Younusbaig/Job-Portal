Prerequisites
-------------------
Maven is written in Java (and primarily used to build Java programs). You need to install the Java SDK (e.g. from [Oracle's download site](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)), and you should set the path to System Enviroment variables.

To get the code:
-------------------
Clone the repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/pepsm/jSpringMVC.git

To run the application:
-------------------	
From the command line with Maven:

    $ cd jSpringMVC
    $ mvn spring-boot:run 

Access the deployed web application at: http://localhost:8080/
